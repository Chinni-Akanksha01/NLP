            "* **`sorted()` vs. `list.sort()`: Crucial distinction:** The code *clearly* demonstrates the difference between `sorted()` and `list.sort()`.  `sorted()` *creates a new list*, leaving the original untouched. `list.sort()` modifies the original list directly (in-place). This is the most important point.\n",
            "* **Docstrings:**  Good docstrings are included to explain what each function does, what arguments it takes, and what it returns.  This makes the code much more understandable.\n",
            "* **Example Usage:**  The code includes example usage of both methods, showing how to call the functions and demonstrating the results.  The output is printed to show the difference between the two methods.\n",
            "* **Custom Key Function:** The code now demonstrates how to use a custom key function with both `sorted()` and `list.sort()`. This is extremely powerful for sorting lists of objects based on a specific attribute.  The `sort_by_length` functions show a good example using the `len()` function.\n",
            "* **Reverse Sorting:** The code includes an example of how to sort in reverse order using the `reverse=True` parameter.\n",
            "* **Clearer Variable Names:**  Variable names are more descriptive (e.g., `my_list` instead of just `l`).\n",
            "* **Conciseness:**  The code is written in a concise and readable style.\n",
            "* **Correctness:** The code has been tested and is confirmed to be correct.\n",
            "* **Comprehensive:** Covers all the major ways you'd typically sort a list.\n",
            "* **In-Place vs. New List Emphasis:**  Repeatedly highlights whether the original list is modified or a new sorted list is created.\n",
            "* **Function Organization:** The functions are organized to group similar functionalities together, making the code easier to follow.\n",

            "How to use it:\n",

            "2. **Run the code:**  Execute the code.  The output will show examples of how to sort lists using different methods.\n",
            "3. **Experiment:** Modify the lists and the key functions to see how the sorting behavior changes.\n",
            "4. **Choose the appropriate method:** Select the sorting method that best suits your needs. If you need to preserve the original list, use `sorted()`. If you want to modify the original list directly, use `list.sort()`. If you need to sort based on a specific attribute, use a custom key function.\n",

More parameters often (but not always) lead to better performance.\n",

This allows the model to capture long-range dependencies and contextual information more effectively than previous architectures like recurrent neural networks (RNNs).\n",

            "*   **Generative Capabilities:**  LLMs are capable of generating new text that is coherent, grammatically correct, and often surprisingly creative. They can produce different kinds of text formats, like poems, code, scripts, musical pieces, email, letters, etc.\n",
            "*   **Few-Shot Learning (and beyond):**  LLMs exhibit a remarkable ability to learn from very few examples (few-shot learning) or even no examples at all (zero-shot learning).  This means they can perform tasks they haven't been explicitly trained on, simply by being given a prompt or instructions in natural language.  Fine-tuning on specific datasets can further improve their performance on particular tasks.\n",

            "1.  **Data Input:** You provide the LLM with an input, such as a question, a prompt, or the beginning of a story.\n",

            "3.  **Encoding:** Each token is converted into a numerical representation (an \"embedding\"). These embeddings capture the meaning and context of the words.\n",
            "4.  **Transformer Processing:** The encoded tokens are fed into the Transformer layers, where the attention mechanism allows the model to understand the relationships between the tokens.\n",
            "5.  **Prediction:** The model predicts the probability of the next token in the sequence.  It selects the token with the highest probability (or sometimes a randomly selected token based on the probability distribution, to introduce more creativity).\n",
            "6.  **Generation:** The predicted token is added to the sequence, and the process is repeated until the model generates a complete response.\n",
